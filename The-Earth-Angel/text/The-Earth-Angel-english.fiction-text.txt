<title>“You Will Meet the Earth Angel”</title>

Dr. Alan Stein (Attn.) did not see that side of Samantha before. As they sat
there in the Chinese restaurant, two days before Ari, their system
administrator left for a trip to Israel, Samantha was emitting a lot of
profanity, and sharing her frustrations of her life and the world. Dr. Stein
was beginning to regret the fact that he agreed to comply with Ari’s wishes,
and invite her to lunch with them.

Samantha Rodriguez was the newest hire at Alan’s law firm - a brilliant
attorney in her early thirties, who looked great, was always groomed,
and got a lot of work done, despite the fact that she almost never stayed
overtime, and also took many days off. One fly in the ointment was the
fact that she was single, sexy, and kept asking her co-workers out on dates,
or accepting their own invitations. As much as Dr. Stein agreed that she had
been a good hire, he was desperately trying to avoid interacting with her.
