<title>“You Will Meet the Earth Angel”</title>

Dr. Alan Stein (Attn.) had not seen that side of Samantha before. As they sat
there in the Chinese restaurant, two days before Ari, their system
administrator, left for a trip to Israel, Samantha was emitting a lot of
profanity, and sharing her frustrations of her life and the world. Dr. Stein
was beginning to regret the fact that he had agreed to comply with Ari’s wishes,
and invite her to lunch with them.

Samantha Rodriguez was the newest hire at Alan’s law firm - a brilliant
attorney in her early thirties, who looked great, was always groomed,
and got a lot of work done, despite the fact that she almost never stayed
overtime, and also took many days off. One fly in the ointment was the
fact that she was single, sexy, and kept asking her co-workers out on dates,
or accepting their own invitations. As much as Dr. Stein agreed that she had
been a good hire, he was desperately trying to avoid interacting with her.

“Anyway, I ended up telling my friend, Jasmine, who can be a real bitch
sometimes, to fuck off, and deal with her troubled life herself. I simply
ran out of patience.” she said.

“Bravo!” Ari said while clapping his hands. “By the way, Samantha, how did
you become a lawyer?”

“Oh, that's a long story.” she said while playing with her fork.

“And we’ve got time to hear it, right Mr. Stein?”

“Yes, I guess we do.” Dr. Stein answered.

“Well, I studied Linguistics as my B.A.,” Samantha said “and by the time I
graduated, my
head was filled with vocabulary, and to a lesser extent - grammatical rules, my
heart was broken from many heartbreaks, and I didn’t know what to do with
the rest of my life. I ended up narrowing it to three options: 1. Find
a paying job - as a programmer or whatever else I could land. 2. Stay in the
academia, studying for a Masters and/or a Ph.D. and — 3. Go to law school.
I figured out fucking Med School was never my thing.”

“Anyway, after consulting it with my friends, I became even less capable
of knowing what to do. So I did the logical thing - I rolled a die.”

“A die?” Ari said.

“Yes, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-sided_die">ten-sided die</a> or
a 1d10 in role-playing game parlence. That’s usually what I use. It landed
on the law school option, so that’s what I decided to pursue.” Samantha said.

“So, you placed your fate in the hand of chance?” Ari asked

“Yes, I did. Nothing wrong with doing that, if you ask me.”

“Well, everyone say you are an excellent attorney.” Ari noted.

“So they do.” Samantha said, “Maybe they are right.”

Then the waitress brought the receipt and along with it, three fortune cookies.

“Oooh good, fortune cookies” Samantha said. “I always reserve some space
for them.”

“I’m too stuffed for that.” Stein said.

“Fair enough, I’ll eat yours too, let’s see what the fortunes say.” Ari
said. “Mine says: ‘You will soon have a change of scenery.’ heh true that.”

“Well, mine says, ” Samantha said “‘You will meet the love of your life.’ -
I sure hope I will. And Mr. Stein, yours read ‘You will meet an Earth Angel’”.

“Heh, judging by your looks, I think he already did.” Ari noted.

“Oh, give me a fucking break” Samantha said, “for your information, that’s
not what an Earth angel is all about.”

“Care to enlighten us?” Ari noted.

“Sure. OK, see, in the Hebrew Bible, which I read in Hebrew, by the way,
the angels were just ordinary people, primarily male, but that’s because
these were really sexist times, heh, who appeared as messengers of God
to guide people in what they should do. And I have a story on my own Earth
Angel.”

“It was at the - TODO FILL IN.”
